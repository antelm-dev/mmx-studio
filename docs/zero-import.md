# Zero × MMX import

Studio builds the Zero × MMX assets from the user's own Steam installs. Nothing
read from the games is committed; the readers live in `src/project-io/import/`
and are exported from `@mmx/project-io/node` (they use `node:fs`, so they stay
out of the renderer-safe `@mmx/project-io` entry).

## Why Studio and mmx-engine, not the Bevy engine

zero-x-mashup proved the idea in three steps:
1. Python readers plus a pygame prototype.
2. A Rust/Bevy engine, `zero_engine` (`engine/`), with native readers. It had
   plugins for physics, combat, Pantheon AI and sound, and it reached sample
   and pixel parity with the Python cache.
3. Its features moved into mmx-engine (Zero loadout, Pantheon, stage music,
   camera zones) and its readers into this Studio import.

The Bevy engine is dropped in favour of mmx-engine + Studio:
- **One engine:** mmx-engine already has the deterministic simulation, replays,
  the browser build and Studio's Play. A second engine meant porting every
  feature twice.
- **The editor comes for free:** the imported Intro Highway is a normal Studio
  project (levels, camera zones, image layers, enemies, bindings), so it can be
  edited, played and exported like any other.
- **The import runs where the user is:** a menu command in Studio replaces the
  `build_cache.py` + converter-script chain. It reads the installs directly,
  without Python.
- **Same results:** the TS readers are checked against the same Python oracle
  as the Rust ones (see [Oracle tests](#oracle-tests)).

zero-x-mashup stays as the research lab: Python tools, notes, the oracle cache,
and the QA screenshots in `qa/`. Its Rust engine and its `game/main.py` are
superseded.

## Legal route

The import follows universal-modder "Pattern 4": reimplement, and read the
user's own files.
- Studio ships code only. It reads the games the user owns, in place, under the
  located install roots, and never writes there. No ROM or game file is ever
  extracted to disk; the MMX1 image lives only in memory.
- No Capcom asset is in this repository. Tests use synthetic data, and the
  oracle tests only run on a machine that has both the installs and the cache.
- The imported project is Capcom-derived. The import writes a catch-all
  `.gitignore` into it (`*`), and the repo ignores `zero-project/`. Keep the
  project private: don't commit, publish or share it.
- The formats were learned from MegaEdX (GPL-2.0), read for reference only, and
  from our own research. No MegaEdX code is used.

## File → Import from Steam installs

1. Install both games from Steam: Mega Man X Legacy Collection and Mega Man
   Zero/ZX Legacy Collection. If they live outside the Steam libraries, set
   `MMXLC_DIR` / `MZZXLC_DIR` before starting Studio.
2. **File → Import from Steam installs…** and pick an **empty** output folder,
   or a previous Zero import. Any other folder is refused: the import never writes
   over other files. Keep the folder outside any git repository.
3. The import runs in the main process (`src/main/ipc/import.ipc.ts`, module
   `import`). It sends each step as an `import-progress` event, which shows as a
   toast: locating the installs, MMX1, MMZ1 sprites, MMZ1 sounds, writing,
   opening. The new project then opens.

The errors are readable as is: a missing install (with the env variable to
set), or an unexpected collection version (the MMX1 ROM is not found in
`RXC1.exe`, the MMZ1 bank counts don't match, or a sound entry is missing).
They show as an "Import failed: …" toast and in Problems, and the current
project stays open.

The pipeline is `readZeroSources()` followed by
`writeZeroProject(out, template, sources)` (`import/zeroProject.ts`). The pure
conversions are in `import/convert.ts`, and the design data (Zero's moves, the
sound roles) in `import/sheets.ts`. A full import takes about 1 s.

To play the result in the browser, run these from the mmx-core-ts checkout:

```sh
pnpm sim -- --project <out>
pnpm factory:dev -- --project <out>
```

For the e2e test only, `MMX_STUDIO_ZERO_IMPORT_CACHE=<dir>` makes the command
read a zero-x-mashup `game/cache`-shaped folder instead of the installs, with
no sounds (`readZeroSourcesFromCache`).

```

### Sprites

- Every frame of every anim gets one fixed cell, 16 cells per row. The cell is the
  smallest even size that fits all frames (72x54 today).
- Frames are mirrored so Zero faces right, like X's frames.
- The engine draws a fixed region centred at `feet - body_hh - 4` (see
  `renderer-pixi/src/render/sprite.ts`), with `body_hh` = 15 for the `player.zero` actor
  (`engine/src/data/actors.ts`), so each frame's mirrored anchor is placed at
  `(cell.w / 2, cell.h / 2 + 19)`.

### Clips

`speed` is 60 and `duration` stays in 1/60 s (`AnimationCursor` holds a frame for
`duration / speed` s). A `0xff` script becomes `loop: false`; a `0xfe` script becomes
`loop: true` with every step kept; a script that loops to step k > 0 also gets
`loopStart: k`, so the wind-up (jump/fall/dash/run/wall slide) plays once and the cursor
then wraps to step k.

Every move of `ZERO_MOVES` (`import/sheets.ts`, moved from zero-x-mashup `zero_moves.json`) is emitted under its own name (`idle`, `run`, `dash`,
`dash_end`, `jump`, `fall`, `land`, `slash_1`..`slash_3`, `dash_slash`, `jump_slash`,
`hurt`, `wall_slide`, `wall_jump`, `wall_dash_jump`, `wall_slash`). The clips X's
abilities play are then added:

| X clip | Zero source | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idle` | `idle` | |
| `walk` | `run` | loop body |
| `walk_start` | `run`, steps before the loop target | one-shot, Walk waits for it to finish. Kept because the engine's Walk still plays `walk_start` then `walk` itself (so the wind-up shows twice); it could derive this from `walk`'s `loopStart` instead |
| `jump` | `jump` | |
| `fall` | `fall` | |
| `dash` | `dash` | |
| `slide` | `wall_slide` | WallSlide plays `slide` |
| `walljump` | `wall_jump` | |
| `damage` | `hurt` | |
| `recover` | **fallback**: first step of `idle` | X lowers his buster; Zero has no such pose. One-shot, Idle waits for it |
| `weak` | **fallback**: `idle` | no low-health stance |
| `beam` | **fallback**: `fall` | no teleport beam |
| `beam_in` | **fallback**: `land`, one-shot | no beam landing |
| `beam_equip` | **fallback**: `idle`, one-shot | no equip pose; one-shot so Intro ends |

Death hides the player sprite and plays no clip. AirDash and DashJump reuse `dash` and
`jump`; X's other clips (`airdash`, `crouch`, `shot_*`, ...) are not played by any ability.

### Pantheon sheet

`pantheonSheets(objects)` packs object 25's 20 frames into fixed cells, 16
per row (`packFrames`):
- The frames are **not** mirrored: the engine's enemy sheets face left, like
  the GBA frames (renderer-pixi draws enemies with scale `-facing`).
- The feet anchor sits 15 px under the cell centre, because renderer-pixi
  centres an enemy frame on its body and `enemy.pantheon`'s body half-height
  is 15.
- The clips follow `PANTHEON_CLIPS` (see the table under MMZ1 below).
  `toClip` converts the scripts, and each clip is checked to loop or not as
  the engine expects.

The shot is built from the frames object 1 script 4 uses (22, 23, 25, 24). They
are mirrored to face right like the player's shots, with the anchor at the cell
centre, into the looping clip `pantheon_shot`.

### Level

| Collision byte | Tile | Slope profile `[left, right]` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `0x00` | Empty (0) | |
| `0x05`..`0x08` | SlopeUpRight (2) | `[0,4]`, `[4,8]`, `[8,12]`, `[12,16]` |
| `0x09`..`0x0c` | SlopeUpLeft (3) | `[4,0]`, `[8,4]`, `[12,8]`, `[16,12]` |
| anything else (`0x34`/`0x35` walkable top, `0x39`/`0x3a`, `0x3b` solid) | Solid (1) | |

The slopes are 4-tile ramps rising 16 px (read from where the bytes sit in the grid:
`05 06 07 08` climbs one row left to right, `0c 0b 0a 09` descends). The engine has no
one-way tile, so walkable tops are solid. One `spawn` object sits at checkpoint 0's
spawn `(128, 256)`; the Intro drops the player onto the road at y = 384. Only checkpoint
0 gets one: the engine requires exactly one `spawn` (`spawn.count`) and has no checkpoint
object, and `stage.json` keeps only the X of checkpoints 1-3. A death respawns at the
level spawn.

#### Camera zones

`stage.json` `cameras[i]` holds checkpoint i's camera limits (`min_x`, `max_x`,
`min_y`, `max_y`, read in the ROM's order after chX/chY, camX, camY, bkgX, bkgY). They bound the view's **top-left** corner; a `camera-zone` object
bounds the whole view, so each becomes:

```text
x = min_x    width  = min(max_x + 398, level width)  - min_x     (398x224 = engine VIEW_WIDTH/VIEW_HEIGHT)
y = min_y    height = min(max_y + 224, level height) - min_y
```

With that mapping the engine's pit rule (zone bottom + 32) lands where MMX's is
(`max_y + 224 + 32`). Consecutive checkpoints with identical limits are one section and
one zone (`camera-checkpoint-<first checkpoint>`): the engine binds the view to the zone
the player is in, so cutting equal limits at each checkpoint X would only shove the view
at every seam. The converter throws if two zones overlap, since the engine would then
pick by hysteresis rather than by stage. Intro Highway today:

| Zone | Checkpoints | Rect | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `camera-checkpoint-0` | 0-2 | (0, 256) 7310x224 | Y locked at 256, X follows Zero |
| `camera-checkpoint-3` | 3 | (0, 768) 8192x224 | the lower band, Y locked at 768 (checkpoint 3's X, 8208, lies past the 8192 px grid) |

So the view holds Y = 256 along the road and does not follow jumps, and falling into the
gap at x = 800 kills at y > 512 and respawns. Zero's screen X settles near 217, not
MMX's 128: the engine's view is 398 wide and it adds its dead zone and look-ahead.

The art becomes two `imageLayers`, both at (0, 0), plus the level `backdrop`:

| Layer id | Asset | `layer` | `parallax` | Why |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `art-background` | `image.background` | `background` | 0.5 | MMX1 scrolls it at camX / 2; its y stays 0 on the highway |
| `art-stage` | `image.stage` | `world-back` | 1 | the foreground painting, locked to the tiles |

`backdrop` is palette colour 0 (`stage.json` `backdrop`) as `#rrggbb`; it fills
whatever both images leave transparent.

#### Enemies

The level gets seven `enemy.pantheon` objects (`pantheon-<i>`) at the
`PANTHEON_SPAWNS` positions (`import/sheets.ts`, moved from zero-x-mashup
`enemies.json`; placed by eye, not MMX1 data). The y of 300 is above the road,
so they drop onto it when the level starts. The first two are on the road
before the gap at x = 800; the others are on the raised section after it.

### Bindings

`game/data.json` binds `playerAnimation` to Zero and `music.stage` to the MMZ1 stage track (engine `bindings.music.stage`, runtime id `musicStage`, looped while a level plays, in the browser build and in Studio Play), with no `playerPointingSheet` since
Zero has no detached arm (the renderer then draws the arm layer from the normal sheet).
`enemyAnimations.pantheon` binds the Pantheon sheet, and
`shotAnimations.pantheon_shot` is added to the borrowed shot clips.
`pickupAnimations` stays empty: the level has no pickups and the build accepts
an empty map.

### Borrowed from the template

The browser build (`pnpm factory:build`/`factory:dev`, mmx-core-ts
`build-tools/src/studioBindings.ts`) requires a non-empty `shotAnimations`,
`hudSprites` with `xBar`, `hpFill` and `weaponBar`, and a sound for every
`GAMEPLAY_SOUND_IDS` entry; the HUD and menus also use `fontUi`. The installs give none of
these, so the import copies them from `templates/mmx-demo`:

- the template's `fontUi`, `sounds`, `shotAnimations` and `hudSprites` bindings,
  verbatim;
- every asset those bindings name, plus the `sheetAssetId` sprite of each effect
  animation, as manifest entries with the template's ids and paths, and their files;
- `ATTRIBUTION.md`.

Template sounds whose id an MMZ1 sound replaces (see [Sounds](#sounds)) are neither
bound nor copied. So Zero currently plays with X's buster shots/effects, HP bar and the
sounds MMZ1 does not map. This is a stopgap until Zero has his own HUD/effects.

### Sounds

Both come from the Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection:

- **Effects:** `ZERO_SOUNDS.sfx` (`import/sheets.ts`, moved from zero-x-mashup
  `sounds.json`) gives, for each role, an entry index among the
  `sound\se\wav\...` entries of `nativePCx64/RZZC/romPC/Zero1SE.arc`. Each
  entry is decoded to 16-bit PCM (see
  [MMZ1 sound effects](#mmz1-sound-effects-importadpcmts)).
- **Music:** `ZERO_SOUNDS.music` (`zero1_bgm/zero1_bgm005.sngw`, the first
  stage) is plain Ogg Vorbis. It is copied to `assets/music/stage.ogg`,
  declared as `music.stage` (kind `sound`) and bound as `bindings.music.stage`.
  MMX1's own Intro music is scrambled and out of scope.

Role mapping, role -> engine sound id (`SOUND_ROLES`; ids from
`@mmx/browser-audio` `GAMEPLAY_SOUND_IDS` plus the optional `slash`):

| Role | Entry | Sound id | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `slash` | 16 | `slash` | optional id, Zero's saber swing |
| `dash` | 19 | `dash` | |
| `land` | 13 | `land` | |
| `buster_shot` | 17 | `lemon` | X's small buster shot id |
| `hurt` | 21 | `damage` | |
| `enemy_shot` | 71 | - | no engine id for enemy shots |
| `wall_kick` | 19 | - | no id of its own: the engine plays `jump` on WallJump |

The roles are still **guessed by ear** (matched against a recording of the real game,
not verified); fix them in `ZERO_SOUNDS` and re-import. Every other id
(`jump`, `wallslide`, `enemyHit`, `playerDeath`, ...) keeps the template sound; MMZ1's
jumps are silent, but an unbound required id would break the build.

## Steam installs (`import/steam.ts`)

| Game | Folder in `steamapps/common` | Checked marker | Override |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mega Man X Legacy Collection (MMX1 ROM inside) | `Mega Man X Legacy Collection` | `RXC1.exe` | `MMXLC_DIR` |
| Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection (ARC archives) | `MZZXLC` | `nativePCx64/` | `MZZXLC_DIR` |

`findSteamGame(game)` returns `{ ok: true, root }` or `{ ok: false, error }`
with a message the UI can show as is. An env override wins when set and must
contain the marker. Otherwise each Steam root (`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam`,
`C:\Program Files\Steam`) is read for `steamapps/libraryfolders.vdf`; every
`"path"  "D:\\SteamLibrary"` line (backslashes escaped) is a library, and the
first `<library>/steamapps/common/<folder>` holding the marker wins. With no
vdf, the roots themselves are the libraries.

The install folders are outside any project root, so the readers use `node:fs`
directly, read only below the located roots, and never write there (see
`mmx-core-ts/docs/path-containment.md`).

## MMX1 Intro Highway (`import/mmx1.ts`)

`readMmx1Install(root)` reads `RXC1.exe` once into memory and returns the
foreground (`stage`) and background RGBA buffers plus the `stage.json` object
(the shape of zero-x-mashup's `game/cache/stage.json`). No ROM file is written.
`encodePng` (`import/png.ts`) turns a buffer into a PNG.

**ROM inside the exe.** The exe holds several SNES images. MMX1 US v1.0 is the
one whose internal header (`"MEGAMAN X"` padded to 21 bytes, at ROM `0x7FC0`)
has map byte `0x30` (LoROM/FastROM) at `+0x15` and version `0` at `+0x1B`; the
image is the 1.5 MB (`0x180000`) that starts `0x7FC0` before the title.
Addresses are SNES LoROM: `pc = (bank & 0x7F) * 0x8000 + (addr & 0x7FFF)`.

**Level 0 pointers** (24-bit pointers at `table + level * 3`): layout
`0x868D24`, scenes `0x868D93`, blocks `0x868E02`, maps `0x868E71`, collision
`0x868EE0`; the background layer has its own layout `0x868F4F`, scenes
`0x868FBE` and blocks `0x86902D` and shares maps, tiles and palettes. For
level 0 they resolve to layout `090140`, scenes `096180`, blocks `0B4428`,
maps `0C8000`, collision `0AE1E1` (PC).

| Data | Format |
| --- | --- |
| Layout | `w, h, used` (in 256 px scenes), then `{ctrl, scene}` runs until `0xFF`: `ctrl & 0x7F` scenes, repeated if bit 7 else counting up |
| Scene | 8x8 u16 block indices (`0x80` bytes) |
| Block | 2x2 u16 map indices (8 bytes) |
| Map (16 px) | 2x2 u16 tile words `vhopppcc cccccccc` (flip V/H, palette `ppp`, tile `0..0x3FF`); `collision[map]` is its collision byte |
| Tile | 8x8 4bpp SNES planar, 32 bytes, from a 32 KB BG VRAM |
| Colour | BGR555, expanded `<< 3` per channel |

**Checkpoints** (`0x86A780`, two levels of u16 offsets: level, then point):
`objLoad, tileLoad, palLoad` (u8) then u16 `chX, chY, camX, camY, bkgX, bkgY,
minX, maxX, minY, maxY`. `tileLoad`/`palLoad` select the dynamic tiles
(`0x321D5`) and palettes (`0x32260`) loaded over the base palette
(`0x868133`) and the RLE tile set (`0x86F56F` config, `0x86F6F7` sources;
RLE: per 8 bytes a control byte, bit 1 = literal, bit 0 = fill byte).
Gotcha: the VRAM destination `(word << 1) - 0x2000` is 16-bit on the SNES and
must wrap with `& 0xFFFF`, or most tiles render as colour 0.

**Output.** Colour index 0 of every tile stays transparent. `stage.json` is
`{cell: 16, w, h, spawn: [chX, chY] of point 0, cameras: [{x, min_x, max_x,
min_y, max_y}] for points 0..3, backdrop: palette[0] as [r, g, b], collision:
rows of collision bytes per 16 px cell}`, with keys in that order.

**Oracle.** `tests/project-io/mmx1.test.ts` compares with the Python cache
(`$ZERO_X_MASHUP_ROOT/game/cache`, default `../zero-x-mashup`) when both it
and the install are present: `stage.json` is byte-identical and the PNG pixels
are identical. The PNG files are not byte-identical: Pillow uses its own
filters, ours writes filter 0.

## MMZ1 Zero and the Pantheon (`import/mmz1.ts`, `import/arc.ts`)

`readMmz1Install(root, anims)` reads `nativePCx64/RZZC/ZC/DATA/obj_fnt_z1.bin`
(tiles, palettes) and `obj_dat_z1.bin` (frames, scripts), which are plain files,
and returns two atlases:

- `zero`: the cache's `zero.png` + `zero.json`, for the streamed animations
  `anims` (the `anim` column of `zero_moves.json`);
- `objects`: static objects 1 (effects) and 25 (Pantheon Hunter) in the same
  shape, keyed `"1"` and `"25"`.

`zero.json` shape: `{ "<key>": { frames: [[x, y, w, h, anchorX, anchorY]],
scripts: [[[frame, duration]]] } }`. The anchor is the character's feet inside
the cropped frame. A duration is in 1/60 s; `0xFE` loops to step `frame`, and
`0xFF` holds.

**Banks.** Both banks start with a 161-entry u32 index, one entry per object.
- **Streamed characters** (Zero is 0..56): the distinct, sorted offsets of
  obj_fnt object 0 entries 64..484 (140 records).
  - Each record holds n parts, each with a 20-byte header `{u32 data off,
    u32 size (low 16 bits), ...}`, then the parts' 4bpp tiles back to back.
  - The matching layout blocks are found in obj_dat, starting at `dofs[64]` (the
    first byte after the indexed layouts), one per record in order. A block is
    `{u32 header length, section offsets...}`.
  - Frame table at the header length: `{u32 4, (u16 piece offset, u8 count,
    u8 part)}`. Scripts at section 1.
  - An optional palette section among sections 2..: `{u16 n, u16 n, n x 16
    BGR555 colours}`. Only block 0 has one (Zero's palettes); the later blocks
    reuse it.
- **Static objects:**
  - obj_fnt: `{u32 header length, u32 size, ...}`, then the tiles, then 16-colour
    palettes up to the next object.
  - obj_dat: `{u32 frame table offset, u32 script section offset}`.
  - Frame entries are `(u16 piece offset, u16 count)`.
- **Script section:** a u32 offset to a table of u16 offsets (relative to the
  table) to step lists.
- **Piece (OAM):** `tile` (in units of 4 tiles), `attr` (`shape << 6 | size << 4`,
  `4` hflip, `8` vflip), `s8 x`, `s8 y`, relative to the feet.
  - Sizes by shape: square 8/16/32/64, wide 16x8/32x8/32x16/64x32, tall
    8x16/8x32/16x32/32x64.
  - Each frame is drawn on a 192x192 canvas with the feet at (96, 144), first
    piece on top, palette 0.
  - Pixels are GBA 4bpp, low nibble first.
- **Packing:** each frame is cropped to its opaque bbox (an empty frame keeps 1 px
  at the origin) and packed left to right in rows of up to 1024 px.

**Pantheon clips** (engine contract, mmx.ts#31; `PANTHEON_CLIPS`):

| Clip | Source | Loops |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `idle` | object 25, script 0 | yes |
| `walk` | object 25, script 1 | yes |
| `aim` | object 25, script 2 | no |
| `shoot` | object 25, script 3 | yes |
| `hit` | object 25, frames 15-16, 6/60 s each (the Stun lasts 12 frames); 17-19 and 14 are death debris | no |
| `pantheon_shot` | object 1, script 4: frames 22, 23, 25, 24 at 4/60 s | yes |

GBA frames face left (gotcha 3).

**ARC v7** (`readArc`, used for the MMZ1 sound banks, e.g. `RZZC/romPC/Zero1SE.arc`):
- header: `"ARC\0"`, u16 version 7, u16 count;
- then count 80-byte entries `{name[64], u32 type hash, u32 compressed size,
  u32 size (low 29 bits), u32 offset}`;
- the data is zlib (first byte `0x78`) or stored as is.

**Oracle.** `tests/project-io/mmz1.test.ts`: `zero.json` is byte-identical to
the Python cache and `zero.png` has identical pixels. The cache has no object
25, so the objects are only checked against the clip contract.

## MMZ1 sound effects (`import/adpcm.ts`)

`RZZC/romPC/Zero1SE.arc` (ARC v7, `readArc`) holds 470 `sound\se\wav\...`
entries. Each is a RIFF WAV in Microsoft ADPCM (format 2, about 48 kHz
stereo). `msAdpcmToPcmWav` decodes one into a 16-bit PCM WAV (`pcmWav`).

Each block holds a header, then 4-bit samples:
- header: `predictor[ch]` (u8, an index into the `fmt ` coefficient pairs),
  then `delta[ch]`, `sample1[ch]` and `sample2[ch]` (i16 each);
- samples: high nibble first, interleaved by channel, as signed values;
- each sample is `trunc((s1 * c1 + s2 * c2) / 256) + nibble * delta`, clamped
  to 16 bits;
- then `delta = max(ADAPT[nibble] * delta >> 8, 16)`;
- each block keeps `samples per block` frames.

Gotcha: the division must round toward zero, as in Microsoft's reference.
`>> 8` floors negative values and drifts.

`tests/project-io/adpcm.test.ts` checks the decoder against ffmpeg. ffmpeg
encodes a synthetic stereo chirp, and our output must equal ffmpeg's own
decoding sample for sample. If ffmpeg is not on PATH, the test is skipped with
a visible warning. The Rust original matched ffmpeg on all 470 game entries.

## Oracle tests

The readers are checked against zero-x-mashup's Python cache (`game/cache`),
which `python game/build_cache.py` builds from the same Steam installs. They
compare the stage, background and Zero atlas pixels, and `stage.json` and
`zero.json` byte for byte: collision, checkpoints and cameras, anchors and
scripts. This is the TS counterpart of the Rust `cargo test --release`.

```bash
# needs the two Steam installs (or MMXLC_DIR / MZZXLC_DIR) and a built cache (python game/build_cache.py)
ZERO_X_MASHUP_ROOT=../zero-x-mashup pnpm test:oracle
```

`pnpm test:oracle` runs only the `oracle:` tests of `tests/project-io/steam`,
`mmx1`, `mmz1` and `zero-project`. The last one runs the whole import on the
real installs and checks the generated project. They also run in `pnpm test`.

What the oracle compares:

| Reader | Compared with the Python cache |
| --- | --- |
| MMX1 | `stage.json` byte-identical (collision, spawn, cameras, backdrop); `stage.png` / `background.png` pixel-identical |
| MMZ1 Zero | `zero.json` byte-identical (frames, anchors, scripts); `zero.png` pixel-identical |
| MMZ1 objects 1/25 | not in the cache: matched once against `xz/tools/mmz_obj.py` (JSON and pixels identical); tests check the clip contract |
| MS-ADPCM | ffmpeg on a synthetic chirp (`adpcm.test.ts`) |

`ZERO_X_MASHUP_ROOT` defaults to `../zero-x-mashup`, relative to the repo
root. Without an install or the cache (CI, other machines), each oracle test
is skipped. It prints `[oracle] SKIPPED "<test>": <reason>`, naming the
missing install or cache files and the `ZERO_X_MASHUP_ROOT` value, and reports
as `# SKIP` with the same reason. The shared gate is `tests/project-io/oracle.ts`.

## Gotchas

Gotchas 1–4 are the numbers used in zero-x-mashup's MODLOG.

1. **The MMX1 VRAM destination is 16-bit.** `(word << 1) - 0x2000` wraps on the
   SNES side. Without `& 0xFFFF`, the main tile set lands past VRAM and most
   tiles render as colour 0 (`vramDest`).
2. **Only MMZ1 layout block 0 carries Zero's palettes.** Blocks without a
   palette section reuse the previous block's (`loadStreamed`).
3. **GBA frames face left.** Zero's sheet is mirrored, because the engine's
   player sheets face right. The Pantheon sheet is not: the engine's enemy
   sheets face left. The shot is mirrored like the player's shots.
4. **The MS-ADPCM predictor divides by 256, rounding toward zero.** `>> 8`
   floors negative values and drifts (`msAdpcmToPcmWav`).

Others:
- **Camera limit order.** The MMX1 checkpoint record stores the camera limits
  after chX/chY, camX, camY, bkgX, bkgY in the order minX, maxX, minY, maxY.
  MegaEdX's struct names suggest minX, minY, maxX, maxY, which is wrong.
- **Two MMX1 US images.** RXC1.exe holds the MMX1 US image twice (v1.0 and
  v1.1), plus the Japanese one. Only v1.0 (header version byte 0) is read.
  Neither image's byte sum matches its header checksum: these are
  collection-patched builds, so don't use the checksum to identify them.
- **Pantheon `hit` clip.** It is frames 15–16 only. In object 25, frames 17–19
  and 14 are death-debris pieces; 15 is the flinch pose and 16 the same with
  the red head. The engine contract (mmx.ts#31) said frames 15–19, but the
  browser check showed a debris piece during the Stun.
- **The gap at x ≈ 800 is a real pit.** It is the broken highway edge. The
  engine kills below the camera zone's bottom + 32, which matches MMX's
  `max_y + 224 + 32`.
- **Pantheon spawns.** They come from zero-x-mashup's `enemies.json`, placed by
  eye, not from MMX1 data. Spawns outside the level are dropped: Studio froze on
  out-of-bounds enemies (flagged separately).

## Research notes (from zero-x-mashup MODLOG)

**Installs** (under Steam `steamapps/common`):
- Mega Man X Legacy Collection: `RXC1.exe` (24,229,288 bytes). Data is in
  `nativeDX10/` (Common, RXC1, X4, XChallenge, XEmu, …). The collection's
  `.arc` files hold native data only for X4–X6, X Challenge, the UI and sound;
  X1–X3 are SNES images stored uncompressed inside RXC1.exe. The headers were
  found by title: ROCKMAN X at 12148448 and 13721312, MEGAMAN X at 14245600 and
  15818464 (exe offsets of the header, spaced 1,572,864 bytes = the MMX1 size).
- Mega Man Zero/ZX Legacy Collection: `MZZXLC/MZZXLC.exe`, data in
  `nativePCx64/RZZC/` (ZC, ZX, ZXA, romPC, DATA). There is no GBA ROM in the
  exe or the arcs: each game is split into per-asset banks,
  `RZZC/ZC/DATA/*_z{1..4}.bin` (z1 = MMZ1). Region copies of some banks are in
  `DATA/USA` and `DATA/Europian`.

**MMX1 collision bytes** seen in level 0:

| Byte | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `0x00` | empty |
| `0x34`, `0x35` | walkable top |
| `0x3B` | solid |
| `0x05`–`0x0C` | slopes |
| `0x39`, `0x3A` | rare, also mapped to Solid |

**MMX1 checkpoints of the Intro Highway:**
- Checkpoints 0–2: camera Y locked at 256, X from 0 to 6912.
- Checkpoint 3: Y locked at 768.
- The background scrolls at camX / 2 (bkgX in the record) with bkgY 0. The
  backdrop is palette colour 0 (dusk purple).

**MMZ1 static objects** (z1):
- Object 1: shared effects. Script 1 is the explosion, 2 a hit spark, 4 the
  looping yellow shot.
- Objects 2–160: the MMZ1 cast. Examples: 25 = Pantheon Hunter (scripts 0 idle,
  1 walk, 2 aim, 3 shoot), Golem 67, Ciel 117–120.
- obj_fnt object 0 is a table of 485 offsets. Entries 0–63 are 32 px-wide
  stills (menu art, title Zero, Cyber-elf portraits); 64–483 are the streamed
  characters.

**MMZ1 streamed characters:**

| Characters | Content |
| --- | --- |
| 0–56 | Zero's animations |
| 57–69 | saber arcs |
| 70 and up | cutscene and boss effects |

Zero's animations used by `ZERO_MOVES`, plus ones not used yet:

| Anim | Content |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | idle |
| 2 | run |
| 3 | dash (script 1 = dash end) |
| 4 | jump (scripts 1 fall, 2 land) |
| 5 | wall slide (s0 enter + loop, s1 arm-forward variant, s2 hold) |
| 6 | wall jump (s0 kick, s1 dash kick) |
| 7 | ladder (not used) |
| 8, 10, 11 | saber combo 1–3 |
| 13 | run + buster (not used) |
| 14 | dash slash |
| 16 | jump slash |
| 17 | wall slash |
| 18 | ladder slash (not used) |
| 49 | hurt |

**Music:**
- MMZ1: `nativePCx64/sound/bgm/wav/zero1_bgm/*.sngw` are 29 plain Ogg Vorbis
  tracks; `zero1_bgm005` plays in the first stage.
- MMX1: `Common/sound/bgm/wav/X1/04_OPENING_STAGE.sngw` (the Intro Highway) is
  scrambled. It is not a 4-byte XOR: the key `c1a53e7d` fits the first bytes,
  but the rest is neither Ogg nor RIFF.

**Timing:** reading both games takes about 40–60 ms in Rust and about 1 s for
the whole TS import, PNG encoding included.

## Open questions

- **Zero's facing while wall-sliding.** The wall-slash arc says Zero faces the
  wall, but the arm-forward slide variant (anim 5 script 1) suggests he faces
  away. The Bevy engine had him face the wall; mmx-engine's Zero should be
  checked against ground truth from the real MMZ1.
- **Sound roles.** `ZERO_SOUNDS.sfx` was matched by ear against a recording of
  the real game. The roles are not all verified (`wall_kick` is a likely
  guess), and enemy hit, explosion and wall kick have no confirmed entry.
- **MMX1 Intro music.** The track is scrambled (see above). Until it is
  decoded, the stage plays the MMZ1 track.
- **MMX1 stage scripting is not imported:** the collapsing road, Bee Blader,
  Vile, and the other Intro Highway enemies. Only the Pantheons from the
  design sheet are placed.
- **Packaged app.** The import borrows from `templates/mmx-demo`, which the
  packaged app (`out/**` only) doesn't ship, like the starter template.
- **Pantheon details** left in the engine: the shot hitbox (a 4x4 guess), and
  the reference's walk toward the player down to `keep_distance` 64 between
  shots.
